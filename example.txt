Why doth one man’s yawning make another yawn; one man’s pissing provoke a second many times to do the like?

Thus the Devill playd at Chesse with mee, and yeelding a pawne, thought to gaine a Queen of me, taking advantage of my honest endeavours; and whilst I labour’d to raise the structure of my reason, hee striv’d to undermine the edifice of my faith.

In prosperity we are insolent and intolerable, dejected in adversity, in all fortunes foolish and miserable. In adversity I wish for prosperity, and in prosperity I am afraid of adversity.

The human species, according to the best theory I can form of it, is composed of two distinct races, the men who borrow, and the men who lend. To these two original diversities may be reduced all those impertinent classifications of Gothic and Celtic tribes, white men, black men, red men. All the dwellers upon earth, "Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites," flock hither, and do naturally fall in with one or other of these primary distinctions. The infinite superiority of the former, which I choose to designate as the great race, is discernible in their figure, port, and a certain instinctive sovereignty. The latter are born degraded. "He shall serve his brethren." There is something in the air of one of this cast, lean and suspicious; contrasting with the open, trusting, generous manners of the other.

Spinoza’s mother-tongue was Spanish; he was a master of Hebrew and had an effective command of Portuguese and Dutch – perhaps also of French.

One of the most important of the terminist logicians of the fourteenth century was William Ockham. Ockham offers a novel system: a terminist logic that is nominalist, not realist. All signs, Ockham maintained, represent individual things, because there are no such things in the world as universals for them to represent. He offers a series of metaphysical arguments against the idea that a universal is a real common nature existing in individuals. If individuals contained universals, then no individual could be created out of nothing, for the universal part of it would be already in existence. On the other hand, if God annihilated an individual, he would destroy simultaneously all other individuals of the same species by wiping out the common nature (OPh.

Not only geometry, but also logic, have undergone profound changes since Spinoza’s day, and while mathematicians and scientists continue to make use of the ‘axiomatic method’, they are no longer so disposed to believe that the axioms of any science are ‘self-evident’, or that the ‘ideas’ necessary to a science may carry some intrinsic mark of truth. Spinoza was himself aware of a major obstacle to that last suggestion, namely that a set of axioms and definitions is composed not of ideas (whatever they may be) but of words, and no word bears its meaning on its face. Only in the context of the system as a whole can the content of any axiom be specified. But how can we guarantee that there is only one consistent interpretation of the system, or that this interpretation will be understood by the enlightened reader?

I have no antipathy, or rather Idio-syncrasie, in dyet, humour, ayre, anything; I wonder not at the French, for their dishes of frogges, snailes, and toadstooles, nor at the Jewes for Locusts and Grasse-hoppers, but being amongst them, make them my common viands; and I finde they agree with my stomach as well as theirs; I could digest a Sallad gathered in a Church-yard, as well as in a Garden. I cannot start at the presence of a Serpent, Scorpion, Lizard, or Salamander; at the sight of a Toad, or Viper, I feel in me no desire to take up a stone to destroy them. I finde not in my selfe those common antipathies that I can discover in others: Those nationall repugnances doe not touch me, nor doe I behold with prejudice the French, Italian, Spaniard, or Dutch; but where I finde their actions in ballance with my Countreymens, I honour, love, and embrace them in the same degree; I was borne in the eighth Climate, but seeme to bee framed, and constellated unto all; I am no Plant that will not prosper out of a Garden. All places, all ayres make unto me one Countrey; I am in England, every where, and under any meridian; I have beene shipwrackt, yet am not enemy with the sea or winds; I can study, play, or sleepe in a tempest. In briefe, I am averse from nothing, neither Plant, Animal, nor Spirit;

Coleridge agreed with this. ‘A poem’, he wrote, ‘is that species of composition, which is opposed to works of science, by proposing for its immediate object pleasure, not truth.’

1. The world and this expanse – or whatever other name men are pleased to call the sky that covers the universe with its vault – are properly held to be a deity,1 everlasting, boundless, an entity without a beginning and one that will never end. Men are not concerned to explore what is extraterrestrial, nor can the human mind make a guess about such things.

It is madness, absolute madness, I repeat, to go out of our world to examine what lies beyond as if our knowledge of all within it were perfect.
